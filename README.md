DESCRIPTION:This code is a Python script that automates the process of analyzing data from a CSV file and creating a PDF report. First, it reads the data from a specified CSV file using the Pandas library. Then, it analyzes the data to generate summary statistics, such as the mean and standard deviation for each column. After that, it creates a PDF report using the FPDF library, where it presents the analysis results in a clear format. Finally, the script includes a command to open the generated PDF report in a web browser, allowing users to easily view the results. Overall, this script simplifies data analysis and reporting tasks.
